Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligience 
ML take a data a figure out the rule himself for us using algorithms 
Neural Networks is a form of ML that uses layered representation of dat a.
Data is the most important part of AI and ML

                              Tensor
is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions
They are the main objects that are passed and manipulated throughout the program
Each Tensor - represnts a partialy defined computation that will eventually produce a value
Rank/degree of tensors means the number of dimensions
tf.rank() == shows the rank of a Tensor

Shape of a Tensor
the amount of elements that exist in each tensor
tensor.shape

   Types of Tensors
*Variable
*Constant
*Placeholder
*SparseTensor

Tensor Session
with tf.Session() as sess:
  tensor.eval() # name of the tensor instead of tensor
